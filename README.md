# TandemRepeats
This resource provides an excel file with a list of validated disease associated unstable tandem repeats, as well as several bed files. These bed files provide the gene name and genomic location relative to GRCh38/hg38 or T2T-CHM13v2.0/hs1. 

There are two files for each genome. 
One file has provides approximate gene boundaries. 
The second file is the repeat region with flanking sequence. The amount of flanking sequence if variable, as each repeat region has different qualities. For repeat regions with multiple repetative sequence motifs, the flanking sequences are longer.
The gene/repeat list will be updated as more disease-associated unstable tandem repeat genes are validated.
