# TandemRepeats
Gene name and genomic location for disease-associated tandemn repeat regions. This resource is provided for GRCh38/hg38 and for T2T-CHM13v2.0/hs1. 
Additionally, there are two files for each genome. 
One file has the gene boundaries (note: absolute start/end are not validated at this point). 
The second file is the repeat region with flanking sequence. The amount of flanking sequence if variable, as each repeat region has different qualities. For repeat regions with multiple repetative sequence motifs, the flanking sequences are longer.
